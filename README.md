### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my repositories are from my creative coding practice. 
I also have a few niche libraries, and my submissions to the Advent of Code.
 
ðŸ“† Currently participating in the Advent of Code 2022, using Typescript and Javascript (non-competitive, goal is to finish all puzzles this year)
ðŸ–¼ I make and sell digital artwork, check it out [@h.scheidl](https://www.instagram.com/h.scheidl/) and ðŸ›’ [hscheidl.art](https://hscheidl.art).  
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to ask better questions and be a better listener.  
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on teaching and mentoring.  
 âš¡ Fun fact: I was born here ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, and I lived many years in ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® and then settled in ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª.
